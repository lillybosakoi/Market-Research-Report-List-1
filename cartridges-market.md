<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cartridges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Split Cartridge</li><li>Integrated Cartridge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cartridge markets are segmented into split cartridges and integrated cartridges. Split cartridges consist of separate components for the ink or toner storage and the print head, allowing users to replace only the empty component, thereby reducing waste and costs. Integrated cartridges, on the other hand, combine the ink or toner supply with the print head in one unit. This design simplifies installation but often leads to increased costs, as the entire unit must be replaced when one part is depleted.</p></p>
