<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The geothermal power market consists of three main types of power stations. </p><p>Dry steam stations utilize steam directly from geothermal reservoirs to generate electricity. Flash steam power stations extract high-pressure hot water, allowing it to "flash" into steam for power generation. Binary cycle stations transfer geothermal heat to a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, enabling energy production in lower-temperature geothermal resources. Each type caters to different geothermal conditions, optimizing energy extraction and efficiency in harnessing geothermal energy for electricity generation.</p></p>
