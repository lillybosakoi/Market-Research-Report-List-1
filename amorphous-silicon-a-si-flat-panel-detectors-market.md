<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Amorphous Silicon (A-Si) Flat Panel Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion FPDs</li><li>Direct Conversion FPDs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Amorphous Silicon (A-Si) flat panel detectors (FPDs) are categorized into indirect and direct conversion types. Indirect conversion FPDs use a two-step process where X-rays are first converted into light, typically using a scintillator, which is then detected by the A-Si photodiode array. In contrast, direct conversion FPDs convert X-rays directly into an electrical signal using amorphous selenium. Each type has distinct advantages, with indirect conversion often offering better image quality, while direct conversion provides improved spatial resolution and efficiency.</p></p>
